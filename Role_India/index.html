            <h1>Report</h1>
            <p>The 10 year report of Technology usage in India has been displayed below</p>
            <p> Indian companies are in a strong position to leapfrog competitors from developed countries in the adoption of business intelligence and data driven decision making. The presence of a large customer base, near universal access to mobile devices, affordable data management solutions and lack of technology debt have primed Indian businesses to invest in big data and advanced analytics technologies in the coming year.</p>

        <div class = "Industrial">
        <h1>Industries</h1>
        <p>Enterprises have long managed their customer facing operations (front office), production/logistics (mid office) and support functions (back office) as three independent silos. However, todayâ€™s digital world is vastly different than it was a few years ago. Today, the way a customer makes decisions is very different, and competition is far more intense to provide the best possible customer experience. This requires integrated back, mid and front office operations, from supply chain to operations, and from finance to IT. Therefore, the trend to connect the enterprise will gain further traction during 2020.</p>
